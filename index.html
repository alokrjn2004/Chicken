    <p>The <b>chicken (Gallus domesticus)</b> is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red
        junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs;
        others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.</p>
    <p>Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There
        are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <h3>Phylogeny</h3>
    <p>Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens
        belong to, survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their
        dinosaur relatives. Chickens are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are
        scientifically classified as the same species. Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with populations of red
        junglefowl. The domestic chicken has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and
        green junglefowl; a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds from the grey
        junglefowl (G. sonneratii).It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of their genome with red
        junglefowl.</p>
    <h3>
        Domestication
    </h3>
    <p>
        According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave
        rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[49] The red junglefowl is well
        adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo
        seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.[50] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of the red
        junglefowl's ability to reproduce prolifically when exposed to a surge in its food supply.[51]

        Exactly when and where the chicken was domesticated remains controversial. Genomic studies estimate that the
        chicken was domesticated 8,000 years ago[45] in Southeast Asia and spread to China and India 2,000 to 3,000
        years later. Archaeological evidence supports domestic chickens in Southeast Asia well before 6000 BC, China by
        6000 BC and India by 2000 BC.[45][52][53] A landmark 2020 Nature study that fully sequenced 863 chickens across
        the world suggests that all domestic chickens originate from a single domestication event of red junglefowl
        whose present-day distribution is predominantly in southwestern China, northern Thailand and Myanmar. These
        domesticated chickens spread across Southeast and South Asia where they interbred with local wild species of
        junglefowl, forming genetically and geographically distinct groups. Analysis of the most popular commercial
        breed shows that the White Leghorn breed possesses a mosaic of divergent ancestries inherited from subspecies of
        red junglefowl.
